# Diabetes Predictions by Using Machine Learning Models

![Database Normalization](D1.jpg)

The goal of this research is to recognize the early signs of diabetes and take preventive measures using information from actual patients in the USA. The data for this study is a portion of the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data published by Kaggle under the name "Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset". It consists of 253,680 observations. The study focused on 11 variables: 10 feature variables and 1 label variable that showed whether someone had diabetes or not. If the binary target variable is “1”, it means the result is positive for diabetic and if it is “0”, it means the result is negative for non-diabetic.

In this study, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree are the machine learning algorithms applied by R software. Besides comparing accuracy, other factors such as precision, recall, F1 score and AUC are evaluated to find out which model performs best. This study consists of exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, result analysis and evaluation, a comparison with other existing studies and a conclusion.
